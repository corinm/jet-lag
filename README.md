# jet-lag

ðŸ›©ðŸ•°ðŸ˜´

Your flight from New York to London takes of at **11pm EST** and lands at **11am UK time**. These times are great for logistics, but not very helpful for judging jet lag. Would you be better off with a later or earlier flight? Will you be waking up at 11am or 6am?

**jet-lag** quickly shows you your take-off and landing times at both your origin and destination.
